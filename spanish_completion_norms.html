<P>Below is an example sentence frame from the dataset, the set
of responses produced with their production probabilities (calculated
using Schwanenfluegel's (1986) multiple production method), and
four measures of contextual constraint. The four measures are
computed as follows:</P>

<P><li>CS=constraint strength (the production probability of the
most expected completion word).</P>

<P><li>TTR=type-token ratio (the number of unique responses divided
by the total number of responses).</P>

<P><li>R=redundancy (an information-theoretic estimate of how
much information about the sentence-final word is contained in
the previous context).</P>

<P><li>MR=mean number of responses (the total number of responses
produced divided by the number of subjects producing at least
one response). <BR>
